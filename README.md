Note about part 7 (osa_7): since I went quite overboard with the expansion of the bloglist app, I encountered a problem where I had to implement a catch-all router because the server could not handle all the requests coming from frontend. This addition is not and will not be implemented in this material, but instead is a working part of the "invididual" bloglist app in my separate repo https://github.com/wtervo/bloglist-final
